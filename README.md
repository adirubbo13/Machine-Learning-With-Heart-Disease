# Machine Learning with Heart Disease

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease. This project was created during the spring semester of my senior year for STAT 375: Data Analysis for Statistical computation. The project is primarily implemented in R, with a Python script used for data importing. Various machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification Trees, and regression using the Caret package, were employed to build predictive models.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification
- Classification Trees
- Regression using Caret package
